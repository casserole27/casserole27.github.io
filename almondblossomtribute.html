<p><strong>Almond trees flowering early in the spring marks one of this season's many symbols of new life. Van Gogh loved nature, and this was one of 
    his favorite subjects. He frequently painted the blossom branches against a blue sky.</strong></p> 
<img src="images/almondblossom.png" class="blossom-drawing" width="75" height="33" alt="">  
<p><strong>The painting was a gift for his brother Theo and sister-in-law Jo, who had just had a baby. Their son, Vincent Willem 
    went on to found the Van Gogh Museum. The painting is one of the most treasured of the family, and has never been sold. 
    It stays in the Van Gogh museum to this day.</strong></p>
<img src="images/almondblossom.png" class="blossom-drawing" width="75" height="33" alt="">  
<p><strong>Painting the branches close-up, and from below, Vincent Van Gogh chose an unusual perspective. It looks as if you are lying
    on the grass looking at the branches above you. Van Gogh drew this inspiration from Japanese printmaking, as well as
    the bold outlines and the positioning.</strong></p>
