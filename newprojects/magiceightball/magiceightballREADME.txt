This is a basic project from Codecademy's Learn JavaScript class.
https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript 
I am making the project my own by combining the JS with HTML and CSS
and adding functionality so users can play the actual game in a browser.

Process:

Semantic HTML file
>basic HTML file setup - doctype, head, etc
>added two forms, one for username input and one for question input
>added placeholders, so we can see where the JS will go

CSS file
>linked to HTML file

JS file
>copied my original code over from Codecademy.
>linked to HTML file
>everything that is logged to the console will be changed over to the result of specific DOM events
>I went through the file and wrote out the logic of the program.
HTML input --> JS takes that input and reveals desired results
